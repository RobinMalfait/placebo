  5 â”‚   It will also add these context lines, to get more insight about your code.

  19 â”‚ â”‚  property. This is a unique identifier per `block`. This will be useful, if you
  20 â”‚ â”‚  have some diagnostics that are located further away from eachother. The same

     Â· â”‚  â”€â”€â”€â”€â”¬â”€â”€â”€â”€

âˆ™ 25 â”‚   We can also write messages that are very long.

âˆ™ 29 â”‚   Last but not least, we have the `notes` feature. You can add notes to your

     â”Œâ”€[./README.md]
     â”‚
  34 â”‚   Oh, and we can also add notes to different diagnostics within the same block. We can do this by
âˆ™ 35 â”‚   adding superscript indicators next to each message and before each note. This allows you to visually

     Â·
  36 â”‚   see which note belongs to which diagnostic.
     Â·
     â”œâ”€
     Â·   This note belongs to the other diagnostic

     Â·
     Â·   - This note belongs to the superscript indicator.
     Â·   - This note also belongs to the superscript indicator.
     Â·     - And also has some nested/child notes.
     Â·     - Just like these right here!

âˆ™ 40 â”‚   There is also a very neat feature for when the actual code itself is super long and doesn't fit on one line. In that

     â”‚     â†³ case we also want to "wrap" the code onto multiple lines and split the diagnostics. This is done because a diagnostic

**Note**, this is still in active development. Currently there is no real API
to use it yet, the diagnostics format can still change, and we may or may not
want to introduce configuration options.

1. `git clone https://github.com/RobinMalfait/placebo && cd placebo`
2. `npm install`
3. `npm run build`
